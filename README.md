# Edwin's Portfolio

I built this project to practice the basics I have learned at PLP, to tell my story, and to create a theme that defines who I am.I'm just a simple guy who enjoys working with networks and gets excited by the flow of data packetsâ€”and Linux administration.  
Just putting it out there: I use Linux, by the way.  
Recently, I've become interested in the DevOps path and have been taking a course by Nana (Techworld with Nana).

5. Things I have learnt

## Build

I chose a simple stack of HTML and CSS to reinforce my foundational skills.

## Difficulties

The main challenges I faced were:
 Managing my time with a busy work scheduleâ€”but we must pursue what we want, no matter what.

## Next move

My next goal is to explore building with a front-end framework like Vue, React, or Svelte to make development easier.

I also want to write an outstanding resume and use it. Honestly, the one I have now isn't good enough to land a gig.

## Things I have learnt

Getting real things done is much harder than just  following along and watching content. Hands-on experience is essential.
